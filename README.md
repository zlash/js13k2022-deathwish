Be careful what you wish for! Usually a tired old clich√© but this time... well you can't be for sure if you don't complete the 13 amazing levels of this puzzle adventure!

Move around using the cursor keys and press R when you are stuck and want to retry the current level.

The game takes a good while to load, please be patient! Even if you think it doesn't it's doing its magic behind!


## Bonus! Script to generate your own progress bar with unicode characters!

Change 1234 with the amount of bytes you currently use and run!

```javascript
{k=1234/1024;for(i=f=0,s="";i<6;f=6*k/13-i,s+=f<=0?"üåë":["üåò","üåó","üåñ","üåï"][((f>1?1:f)*3)|0],i++);`${s} ${(k*1000|0)/1000} KiB / 13 KiB #js13k`}
```
